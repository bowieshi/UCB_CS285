\section{Submitting the code and experiment runs}
In order to turn in your code and experiment logs, create a folder that contains the following: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A folder named \texttt{data} with all the experiment runs from this assignment.
    % For Q-learning, you need to submit one run for Q1, two runs for Q2, and three runs for Q3. These folders can be copied directly from the \texttt{data} folder. For the actor critic section, likewise submit one folder for each run.
    \textbf{Do not change the names originally assigned to the folders, as specified by  \texttt{exp\_name} in the instructions. Video logging is disabled by default in the code, but if you turned it on for debugging, you will need to run those again with \texttt{--video\_log\_freq -1}, or else the file size will be too large for submission.}
    \item The \texttt{cs285} folder with all the \texttt{.py} files, with the same names and directory structure as the original homework repository (excluding the \texttt{data} folder). Also include any special instructions we need to run in order to produce each of your figures or tables (e.g. ``run python myassignment.py -sec2q1'' to generate the result for Section 2 Question 1) in the form of a README file.
    % Note that this assignmentâ€™s plotting must be done in a python script, such that running a single script like this can generate the plot.
\end{itemize}

As an example, the unzipped version of your submission should result in the following file structure. \textbf{Make sure that the submit.zip file is below 15MB and that they include the prefix \texttt{q1\_}, \texttt{q2\_}, \texttt{q3\_}, etc.}

\begin{forest}
  for tree={
    font=\ttfamily,
    grow'=0,
    child anchor=west,
    parent anchor=south,
    anchor=west,
    calign=first,
    edge path={
      \noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}]
      (!u.south west) +(7.5pt,0) |- node[fill,inner sep=1.25pt] {} (.child anchor)\forestoption{edge label};
    },

% \todo{tree probably needs to be updated}
% \end{question}

If you are a Mac user, \textbf{do not use the default ``Compress'' option to create the zip}. It creates artifacts that the autograder does not like. You may use \texttt{zip -vr submit.zip . -x "*.DS\_Store"} from your terminal from within the top-level \verb|cs285| directory.

Turn in your assignment on Gradescope. Upload the zip file with your code and log files to \textbf{HW3 Code}, and upload the PDF of your report to \textbf{HW3}.

\paragraph{SAC-related questions.} 
We wanted to address some of the common questions that have been asked regarding Question 6 of the HW. The full algorithm for SAC is summarized below, the equations listed in this paper will be helpful for you: {\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905}}. Some definitions that will be useful:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is alpha and how to update it: Alpha is the entropy regularization coefficient denoting how much exploration to add to the policy. You should update based on Eq. 18 in Section 5 in the above paper as follows: 
    $$
    J(\alpha)=\mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{a_t \sim \pi_t}[-\alpha\log_{\pi_t}(a_t|s_t) - \alpha\bar{\mathcal{H}}].
    $$
    \item Target entropy is the negative of the action space dimension that is used to update the alpha term.
    \item SquashedNorm: This is a function that takes in mean and std as in previous homeworks, and will give you a distribution that you can sample your action from. 
    \item To update the critic, refer to how to update Q-function parameters in Equation 6 of the paper above as follows: \\
    $$J_{Q}(\theta) = Q_{\theta}(s_t, a_t) - (r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma (Q_{\bar{\theta}}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - \alpha \log(\pi_{\phi}(a_{t+1}, s_{t+1})))$$
    \item To update the policy, follow Equation 18: \\
    $$J(\alpha) = E_{a_t \sim \pi_t} [- \alpha \log \pi_{t}(a_t|s_t) - \alpha \bar{\mathcal{H}}]$$
    \item You don't need to alter any parameters from the SAC run commands. The correct implementation should work with the provided default parameters.
    
\end{enumerate}
